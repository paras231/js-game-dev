Ladder and Ball Game This project is a simple 2D physics-based game
built using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. In this game, a ball slides
along a ladder inside a rectangular box, with physics interactions like
sliding, bouncing, and changing angles. The game demonstrates basic
physics and animation principles using vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas
API.

Game instructions and overview Features Canvas Rendering: The game uses
the HTML5 Canvas API to render the ball, ladder, and boundaries. Physics
Implementation: Basic physics to simulate ball movement, ladder angles,
and gravity. Adjustable Ladder: The angle of the ladder can be modified
to influence the ball's sliding behavior. Collision Detection: The ball
detects the canvas edges and "bounces" when it reaches the box
boundaries. Drag-and-Drop Support: The game allows dragging the ladder
to adjust its angle, affecting the ball’s motion. Technologies Used
HTML5 Canvas Vanilla JavaScript (ES5/ES6) CSS (for basic styling)
